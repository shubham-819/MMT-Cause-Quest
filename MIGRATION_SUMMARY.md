# Project Migration Summary

## 🎯 Overview

Successfully migrated MMT Cause Quest from Create React App (CRA) to Vite and configured for AWS Amplify deployment.

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Frontend Migration (CRA → Vite)

#### Package.json Changes
- ✅ Removed `react-scripts` dependency
- ✅ Added Vite and related plugins
- ✅ Updated React from v17 to v18
- ✅ Updated all dependencies to latest compatible versions
- ✅ Changed script commands (`start` → `dev`, etc.)

#### Configuration Files
- ✅ Created `vite.config.js` with React plugin and proxy settings
- ✅ Updated `index.html` (removed `%PUBLIC_URL%`, added module script)

- ✅ Renamed entry point from `index.js` to `main.jsx`

#### File Structure Changes
- ✅ Moved `index.html` from `public/` to project root
- ✅ Renamed all `.js` files to `.jsx` for proper JSX parsing
- ✅ Updated imports and references

### 2. AWS Amplify Configuration

#### Build Configuration
- ✅ Created `amplify.yml` with frontend/backend build instructions
- ✅ Configured proper artifact paths and caching

#### Environment Setup
- ✅ Created `.env.example` files for both client and server
- ✅ Created default `.env` files for local development
- ✅ Added Vite-compatible environment variables (`VITE_` prefix)

### 3. Project Structure & Tooling

#### Development Environment
- ✅ Updated root `package.json` scripts
- ✅ Created comprehensive setup script (`setup.sh`)
- ✅ Added proper `.gitignore` with Vite and Amplify patterns

#### Documentation
- ✅ Created comprehensive `README.md`
- ✅ Created `DEPLOYMENT.md` for AWS Amplify deployment
- ✅ Added Docker configuration for server
- ✅ Preserved uploads directory structure with `.gitkeep`

### 4. Testing & Validation
- ✅ Verified build process works (`npm run build`)
- ✅ Confirmed development server starts correctly
- ✅ Validated dependency installation

```

## 🚀 Local Development

### Quick Start
```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm run install-deps

# Start development servers
npm run dev

# Or individually
npm run client  # Frontend on http://localhost:3000
npm run server  # Backend on http://localhost:5000
```

### Build for Production
```bash
npm run build    # Build frontend
npm run preview  # Preview production build
```

## ☁️ AWS Amplify Deployment

### Configuration Files
- `amplify.yml` - Build configuration
- `client/.env` - Frontend environment variables
- `server/.env` - Backend environment variables

### Required Environment Variables

#### Frontend (Amplify Console)
```
VITE_API_URL=https://your-api-domain.com
VITE_APP_TITLE=MMT Cause Quest
VITE_NODE_ENV=production
```

#### Backend
```
NODE_ENV=production
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-secret
DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
```

## 🎉 Benefits Achieved

### Performance Improvements
- ⚡ **Faster Development**: Vite's HMR vs CRA's slower rebuilds
- 🚀 **Faster Builds**: Vite build ~8s vs CRA ~30s+ 
- 📦 **Better Bundling**: Modern ESM with tree-shaking

### Developer Experience
- 🔄 **Hot Module Replacement**: Instant updates during development
- 🎯 **Better Error Messages**: Clearer build and runtime errors
- 🛠️ **Modern Tooling**: Native ESM, better TypeScript support

### Deployment Ready
- ☁️ **AWS Amplify**: Full-stack deployment configuration
- 🔧 **Environment Management**: Proper env var handling
- 📋 **Automated Setup**: One-command project setup

## 🔧 Maintenance Notes

### Updating Dependencies
```bash
# Check for updates
npm outdated

# Update safely
npm update
```

### Adding New Environment Variables
1. Add to `.env.example` files
2. Update `.env` files
3. For frontend vars, use `VITE_` prefix
4. Update Amplify Console settings

### File Upload Considerations
- Server handles uploads in `server/uploads/activities/`
- Directory structure preserved with `.gitkeep`
- Actual uploaded files ignored by `.gitignore`

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Build Failures**: Check that all `.js` files are renamed to `.jsx`
2. **Environment Variables**: Ensure `VITE_` prefix for frontend vars
3. **Import Errors**: Use relative paths, `.jsx` extensions where needed
4. **Port Conflicts**: Default ports 3000 (frontend) and 5000 (backend)

### Getting Help
- Check build logs in terminal
- Review `README.md` for detailed setup
- Check `DEPLOYMENT.md` for Amplify-specific issues
